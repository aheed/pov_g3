sim:
Black background*
Change pen width*
Remove unnecessary stuff
Share geometry file with client and with sketch
change to clockwise

Pic Client:
parameterized intensity*
end output with newline*
configurable zoom
change to clockwise*
update usage info

Video Client:
No-scaling mode to optimize?

new algo, weighted pixel influence
  variable sector-led-combo area of pixel influence size
    square l = square( max(ledradius * factor1, ledsectorradius * factor2))
  variable sector-led-combo area of pixel influence shape
    more tangential reach for leds far from the centre

Implement use of yflip in LDgetLedDataFromBmpData4

sketch:

hw:
accelerometer for monitoring balance?

web based simulator:
  Use correct class as argument SignalR method "UpdatePOV". Make the byte array readable as an array of numbers on the client side.*
  Use MessagePack (instead of the default json format) to reduce data size on "UpdatePOV".
  make basic canvas based redraw function*
  Make the canvas resizeable (change with window size)
  Black background*
  General cleanup
  dockerize
  
  
monpov:
test against sketch*

other:
Try using ImageMagick to gamma-correct pics in a pre-process step before uploading
Build script taking number of sectors as argument

Problem:
povsim fails when using the file 1200px-Breathe-face-smile.svg.bmp
example: 
./picg3 127.0.0.1 1200px-Breathe-face-smile.svg.bmp  -a4 -b 64 g

No problem with other files!!
Solved: It was a signalR message buffer size limitation. Fixed by configuring the hub with a larger message buffer.
