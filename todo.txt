sim:
Black background*
Change pen width*
Remove unnecessary stuff
Share geometry file with client and with sketch
change to clockwise

Pic Client:
parameterized intensity*
end output with newline
configurable zoom
change to clockwise

Video Client:
No-scaling mode to optimize?

new algo, weighted pixel influence
  variable sector-led-combo area of pixel influence size
    square l = square( max(ledradius * factor1, ledsectorradius * factor2))
  variable sector-led-combo area of pixel influence shape
    more tangential reach for leds far from the centre

Implement use of yflip in LDgetLedDataFromBmpData4

sketch:

hw:
accelerometer for monitoring balance?

web based simulator:
  make basic canvas based redraw function
  Add to repo - combine localscribble/signalrsample/simple with localscribble/signalrsample/syncserver
  
monpov:
test against sketch*
